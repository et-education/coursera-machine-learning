## Coursera / Machine Learning / Week 5
### Neural Networks Learning

During the excercise, the following code was implemented:
* sigmoidGradient.m - Compute the gradient of the sigmoid function 
* randInitializeWeights.m - Randomly initialize weights
* nnCostFunction.m - Neural network cost function
