## Coursera / Machine Learning / Week 4
### Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

During the excercise, the following code was implemented:
* lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function
* oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
* predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier 
* predict.m - Neural network prediction function
