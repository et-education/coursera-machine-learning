## Coursera / Machine Learning / Week 9
### Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

During the excercise, the following code was implemented:
[⋆] estimateGaussian.m - Estimate the parameters of a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix
[⋆] selectThreshold.m - Find a threshold for anomaly detection
[⋆] cofiCostFunc.m - Implement the cost function for collaborative filtering
