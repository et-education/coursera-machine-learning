## Coursera / Machine Learning / Week 8
### K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

During the excercise, the following code was implemented:
* pca.m - Perform principal component analysis
* projectData.m - Projects a data set into a lower dimensional space 
* recoverData.m - Recovers the original data from the projection 
* findClosestCentroids.m - Find closest centroids (used in K-means) 
* computeCentroids.m - Compute centroid means (used in K-means) 
* kMeansInitCentroids.m - Initialization for K-means centroids
